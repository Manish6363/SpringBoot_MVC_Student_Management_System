# SpringBoot-MVC-Student-Management-System

## Technology Used [ Java + Spring-Boot + Spring-MVC + Spring-JPA + Hibernate + MySQL]
### 1. Backend Technologies
      
**Spring Boot**: Framework for building the standalone, production-ready Spring-based MVC web application.
      
**Spring MVC**: Handles HTTP requests and responses following the Model-View-Controller architecture.

**Java**: Primary programming language used for backend development and business logic.

**Hibernate (JPA)**: Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for managing database entities and interactions.

**Servlet API**: Manages HTTP requests and sessions at the server-side.

### 2. Frontend Technologies
**JavaServer Pages (JSP)**: Used to create dynamic web pages and render views for user interactions.

**HTML & CSS**: For structuring and styling the frontend user interface.

### 3. Database Technologies
**MySQL**: Relational database management system used to store student data and other persistent information.

**JDBC**: Java Database Connectivity API (used under the hood via Hibernate) for database communication.


## Purpose of the Project
The primary goal of this application is to demonstrate the implementation of a real-world web-based CRUD system using modern technologies while solving a practical problemâ€”managing student data efficiently. This includes capturing student information such as name, contact details, registration number, and profile image in a central system.

The system is designed to:

  - Allow student self-registration with personal and academic details.

  - Enable secure login using a registration number and password.

  - Provide a personalized dashboard displaying logged-in student data and a directory of other students.

  - Support profile updates, including image replacement.

  - Handle multipart file uploads (e.g., profile pictures) with a secure file size limit.

  - Present information dynamically using JSP views, offering a simple and user-friendly interface.
